== Install Basic Development Tools

=== Common CLI Tools

In MacOS it is relatively easy to get set up with basic command line development tools. This includes things like gcc, g++, git, make, indent, and many more.

To install these tools all at once run the following command in a terminal:

`xcode-select --install`

This will open a prompt asking you to install xcode dev tools, press install.

After this is done, try running `gcc --version` and/or `git --version` in the terminal to see if gcc/git is properly installed.

=== Homebrew

For everything else that is not included with the xcode-select tool there is Homebrew. This gives you an `apt` like package manager that you can use to install software from the command line.

Install homebrew with this command:

[%autofit]
....
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
....

Once this is installed you can use the `brew install` command to install the rest of the basic tools.

==== Getting the rest of the required tools

Now run these commands:

* `brew install npm` - Get the node.js package manager (used for qemu)
* `brew install screen` - Terminal multiplexer for connecting to UART
* `brew install tkdiff` - GUI diff tool (if `diff` is too spartan for you)

== Download and Install STM32CubeIDE

STM32CubeIDE is an Eclipse based Integrated Development Environment.
STM32CubeIDE integrates the popular Eclipse IDE, STM32CubeMX Configuration Tool, STM32 Arm Cross-Compiler, and the ST-Link Debugger into one package.

You will need a ST.com user account to be able to download the STM32CubeIDE.
Go to the URL below to create an account:

https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/user-registration.html

Download the latest version of the STM32CubeIDE software package from the following location:

https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html

Navigate to the `Get Software` section and Click on the `Get Software` box for the STM32CubeIDE-Mac installer.

Extract and run the dmg for STM32CubeIDE that you previous downloaded.

Read the License Agreement and select `I Agree`

== Install QEMU Eclipse Tools

=== Install the xPack Package Manager - xpm

This tool is installed via the node.js package manager that has already been installed in a previous step. Use the following command in a terminal to install:

`npm install --global xpm`

=== Install gnu-mcu-eclipse/qemu and gnu-mcu-eclipse/arm-none-eabi-gcc

Now install arm qemu and the arm compiler using xpm:

`xpm install --global @xpack-dev-tools/qemu-arm@latest`

`xpm install --global @gnu-mcu-eclipse/arm-none-eabi-gcc`

These commands will install the tools to a fixed directory located at `~/Library/xPacks/` . In this area will be bin directories holding the binaries for these tools.

=== Install the GNU MCU Eclipse Plugin

Tip: For more information see https://gnu-mcu-eclipse.github.io/plugins/install/

* From inside Eclipse (i.e. STM32CubeIDE)
* Go to the Eclipse menu → Help → Eclipse Marketplace…,
* Find **Eclipse Embedded CDT** and press install

ADALM2000 has the following features:

* Two-channel USB digital oscilloscope
* Two-channel arbitrary function generator
* 16-channel digital logic analyzer (3.3V CMOS and 1.8V or 5V tolerant, 100MS/s)
* 16-channel pattern generator (3.3V CMOS, 100MS/s)
* 16-channel virtual digital I/O
* Two input/output digital trigger signals for linking multiple instruments (3.3V CMOS)
* Single channel voltmeter (AC, DC, ±20V)
* Network analyzer – Bode, Nyquist, Nichols transfer diagrams of a circuit. Range: 1Hz to 10MHz
* Spectrum Analyzer – power spectrum and spectral measurements (noise floor, SFDR, SNR, THD, etc.)
* Digital Bus Analyzers (SPI, I²C, UART, Parallel)
* Two programmable power supplies (0…+5V , 0…-5V)
