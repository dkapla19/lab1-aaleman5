=== Install QEMU Eclipse Tools

We first need to install some underlying tools to help install the toolchain and the finally launch Eclipse to install the Eclipse Plugin that makes using the tools easy.


==== Install Node Package Manager - npm

TIP: For more information see: https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm



Download the LTS Windows Installer (.msi) for either 32-bit of 64-bit fore NodeJS which includes the Node Package Manager (NPM) from the following location: https://nodejs.org/en/download/


image::images\dev_environment_win-43cf1.png[]

Execute the downloaded installer and accept all the default settings.


=== Install the xPack Package Manager - xpm

TIP: For more information see: https://www.npmjs.com/package/xpm

*Windows*
----
C:\>npm install --global xpm
C:\>setx Path "%Path%;%APPDATA%\npm"
----



//TODO - Move this mac specific doc
//*MacOSX*
//----
//$ mkdir -p "${HOME}"/Library/npm
//$ npm config set prefix "${HOME}"/Library/npm
//$ echo 'export PATH="${HOME}"/Library/npm/bin:${PATH}' >> "${HOME}"/.profile
//$ source "${HOME}"/.profile
//$ npm install --global xpm
//----


//TODO - Move this linux specific doc
//*Linux*
//----
//$ mkdir -p "${HOME}"/opt/npm
//$ npm config set prefix "${HOME}"/opt/npm
//$ echo 'export PATH="${HOME}"/opt/npm/bin:${PATH}' >> "${HOME}"/.profile
//$ source "${HOME}"/.profile
//$ npm install --global xpm
//----


=== Install gnu-mcu-eclipse/qemu and gnu-mcu-eclipse/arm-none-eabi-gcc

TIP: For more information see: https://gnu-mcu-eclipse.github.io/install/

TIP: For more information see: https://gnu-mcu-eclipse.github.io/qemu/install/

TIP: For more information see: https://gnu-mcu-eclipse.github.io/windows-build-tools/install/

With xpm now installed, you should be able to run the follow commands:



*All Operating Systems*
----
$ xpm install --global @xpack-dev-tools/qemu-arm@latest
$ xpm install --global @xpack-dev-tools/windows-build-tools@latest
----

This will always install the latest available version, in the central xPacks repository, which is a platform dependent folder:

* Windows: %APPDATA%\xPacks (e.g. C:\Users\gcrum\AppData\Roaming\xPacks)

//TODO: move
//* macOS: ${HOME}/Library/xPacks
//* GNU/Linux: ${HOME}/opt/xPacks


=== Install the GNU MCU Eclipse Plugin


Tip: For more information see https://gnu-mcu-eclipse.github.io/plugins/install/

* From inside Eclipse (i.e. STM32CubeIDE)
* go to the Eclipse menu → Help → Eclipse Marketplace…,
* find **Eclipse Embedded CDT** and press install

==== Chocolatey

The Chocolatey Package Manager for windows will be used to quickly and easily install other required applications.
The use of Chocolatey is optional, but highly recommended.
You can install all the required tools without using Chocolatey by following the
provided links and following the download/install instructions provided by the developers.

To install Chocolatey and most packages from above:
Open Power Shell as Administrator and run the following commands

```
Get-ExecutionPolicy
Set-ExecutionPolicy AllSigned
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
```

Chocolatey should now be installed.
You can verify it is install and working by using the help command:
```
choco -?
```

Now that Chocolatey is installed, you can install the remaining packages:

```
choco install -y git
choco install -y gitextensions
choco install -y p4merge
choco install -y mingw
choco install -y gnuwin32-coreutils.portable
choco install -y teraterm
```

TIP: You can search for other packages that can be install with Chocolatey here: https://chocolatey.org/packages/
